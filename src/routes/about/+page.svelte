		<p class="text-xl leading-8">
			The Journal was started by Issac Yoo in 2024 to try an premote computer science at uva.
			Becuase although computer science at UVA has recived a large amount of attention and funding
			from the university student groups related to CS have struggled to premote themselves.
			Motivated by this Issac set out to create the journal to help premote student led computer
			science activites at UVA. Additonaly it is the journals mission to help premote the unique and
			interesting computer sceience research being at UVA. Everyone knows the graduate students and
			profssors are doing research on the cutting edge of computer science technology, but to the
			average student is never exposed to that research. So, the journal is also commited to
			bringing the attention due to UVA's hard working researchers
